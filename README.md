Redmonder palettes

Redmonder is an R package that helps create nice-looking color palettes based on colour schemes inspired by Microsoft(r) applications. Redmonder is a fork of RColorBrewer. See RColorBrewer documentation for more information.

The fundamental diference between RColorBrewer and Redmonder is the included color palettes. RColorBrewer is based on the design principles established by the Color Brewer project, while Redmonder does not. Redmonder is not designed as a replacement for RColorBrewer, but as an alternative for when the design principles of ColorBrewer are not required.
